# Multi-Level-Feedback-Queue-Scheduler
Built an MLFQ scheduler with four priority queues in C. The top queue (numbered 3) has the highest priority and the bottom queue (numbered 0) has the lowest priority. When a process uses up its time-slice (counted as a number of ticks), it will be downgraded to the lower priority level. The time-slices for higher priorities are shorter than lower priorities. The scheduling method in each of these queues is round-robin, except the bottom queue which is implemented as FIFO.
